practice code using loops and small single page main with methods on the same page. 

Preparing to move the code to a gate "open and close" app to implement on a raspberry pi 
IOT using a 115 vac powered reversable drill (gearhead).
Plan is to replace the switch in the trigger with a set of "direction" relays using the pivot points of the gate as the cenetr of the gearing.

I expect it to be slow moving with the prototype drill motor but should be a nominal speed when configured with a larger 1 hp gearhead motor.
